        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Payment methods have been traditionally provided by centralized companies. However, cryptocurrencies have opened opportunities for decentralized finance. However, one of the main drawbacks
            of sending payments with cryptocurrencies are transaction fees. With traditional payment methods, transaction fees are rarely required. However, with cryptocurrencies, transaction fees are always
            required from the sender. As adoption of cryptocurrencies grows, the need to minimize transaction fees is important for both the user experience and adoption rates. One solution
            is to create a payment channel, which will allow a sender to make continuous payments to a reciever within a predefined time period but only requiring a single transaction fee from both
            parties: one for opening the payment channel by the sender and another for closing the payment channel by the reciever. Current approaches to this framework requires at least five seperate
            applications to work, one of which requires some programming knowledge. The complexity of setting up this framework not only overcomplicates the process but also creates a steep learning curve
            to use such a framework. In this project, we condense four of the five applications required to create a payment channel into a single decentralized application, which minimizes the number
            of applications required to only two and also heavily reduces the learning curve to use such a framework.
